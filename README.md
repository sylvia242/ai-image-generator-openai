# AI Image Generator

This Python script is based on the prompt structure from the HostLux AI Interior Design Platform. It uses OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision to analyze uploaded images and generate detailed design recommendations and transformations.

## Features

- üñºÔ∏è **Image Analysis**: Upload any image and get detailed AI analysis
- üé® **Design Recommendations**: Get specific design transformation suggestions
- üéØ **Multiple Styles**: Support for various design styles (modern, rustic, minimalist, etc.)
- üìä **Structured Output**: Results in both human-readable format and JSON
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Customizable**: Add custom instructions and design preferences

## Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Setup OpenAI API Key**:
   - Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Create a new API key
   - Choose one of these setup methods:
   
   **Method 1: Config File (Easiest)**
   ```bash
   cp config_template.py config.py
   # Edit config.py and uncomment/set the API_KEY variable
   ```
   
   **Method 2: Environment Variable**
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
python ai_image_generator.py path/to/your/image.jpg
```

## Original Prompt Source

This script is based on the AI prompts found in the HostLux AI Interior Design Platform repository:
- Repository: https://github.com/MarvinFernie/fern-project-new-project-8370a695.git
- Original prompt structure from: `src/app/api/generate-design/route.ts`

The original platform was designed for Airbnb interior design optimization, but this script generalizes the concept for any image analysis and design recommendations.
